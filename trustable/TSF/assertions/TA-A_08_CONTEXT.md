**Guidance**

Although it is practically impossible to specify all of the necessary behaviours
and required properties for complex software, we must clearly specify the most
important of these (e.g. where harm could result if given criteria are not met),
and verify that these are correctly provided by uProtocol.

The specified expectations should be verified using tests, which demonstrate
that the required properties of behaviours are present for a specified set of
use cases and/or system contexts for uProtocol. The effectiveness of these tests
should also be confirmed by appropriate and credible validation strategies, such
as false negative testing (reproducing a test's failure conditions and
confirming that it fails as expected).

**Evidence**

- List of expectations

**Confidence scoring**

CS-A_08 is based on our confidence that the list of Expectations is accurate
and complete, that Expectations are verified by tests, and that the
effectiveness of these tests is validated by appropriate strategies.

**Checklist**

- How has the list of expectations varied over time?
- How confident can we be that this list is comprehensive?
- Could some participants have incentives to manipulate information?
- Could there be whole categories of expectations still undiscovered?
- Can we identify expectations that have been understood but not specified?
- Can we identify some new expectations, right now?
- How confident can we be that this list covers all critical requirements?
- How comprehensive is the list of tests?
- Is every Expectation covered by at least one implemented test?
- Are there any Expectations where we believe more coverage would help?
- Are the test validation strategies credible and appropriate?
- What proportion of the implemented tests are validated?
