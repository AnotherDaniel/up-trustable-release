**Guidance**

We need to perform tests to verify expected behaviours and properties of uProtocol
in advance of every candidate release.

We also need to validate these tests, to confirm that they do actually test
for the expected behaviours or properties, and that test failures are
properly detected. Usually this can be done by inducting software faults to
exercise the tests and checking that the results record the expected failure.

Similarly we need to verify that prevention measures and mitigations continue
to work for each uProtocol candidate release, and in production.

All these validated test results and monitored advance warning signal data from production
must be collected and analysed on an ongoing basis. We need to notice when
results or trends in advance warning signals change, and react appropriately.
