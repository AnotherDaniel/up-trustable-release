The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services/Builds)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-builds), as well as the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Legal documentation requirements / Contributor Guide)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-contributor), states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

Eclipse projects must ensure that community members can build project artifacts from source with reasonable effort, regardless of whether they use the Eclipse Foundation’s Common Build Infrastructure (CBI) or their own build systems. Projects are encouraged to use CBI but are not strictly required to do so.

To support adoption and contributions, projects should maintain a Contributor Guide (typically CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository root). This file must be concise, accessible, and include:

* Project name and description
* Links to the project website and documentation
* Eclipse Foundation Terms of Use
* Main communication channel(s)
* Canonical source repositories
* Clear build and contribution instructions (e.g., how to submit pull requests)
* Link to sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)

Optional additions include links to downloads and more detailed contribution documentation. Well-documented build instructions and contribution guidance ensure transparency, reduce barriers for new contributors, and strengthen the project’s community and sustainability.

---

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files in project repositories
* Developer documentation on project websites
