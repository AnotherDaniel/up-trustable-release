The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#project-resources-and-services) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

---

Eclipse Foundation projects must use the provided infrastructure and follow practices that ensure high-quality, auditable contributions.

Key requirements include:

__Version control and attribution__: All source code must be maintained in Eclipse-managed Git repositories (GitLab or GitHub), ensuring full traceability of changes and contributor attribution.
__Code reviews__: Projects are strongly encouraged to enforce peer reviews for all contributions. Changes should only be merged after review and explicit approval by another committer, ensuring code quality and shared ownership.
__Issue tracking__: All bugs and feature requests must be tracked in Eclipse-managed issue trackers, with links between commits and issues to document the rationale behind changes.
__Third-party content review__: Any external dependencies must be vetted for compliance with licensing and intellectual property requirements.
__Metadata and governance__: Projects must keep their metadata current and use Eclipse services for builds, communication, and artifact signing, ensuring transparency and proper oversight.

By adopting peer reviews and approval-based merging, projects build trust, maintain high standards of quality, and encourage collaboration in a transparent, community-driven way.

---

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Git commit history with author attribution
* Pull/merge request records with review history
