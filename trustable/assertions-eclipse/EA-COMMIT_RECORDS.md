The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services / Git Commit Records)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit) and [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Community / Issues](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#community-issues) suggest that Eclipse project commit records have a consistent form, include the author and should reference the issue that they are addressing.
