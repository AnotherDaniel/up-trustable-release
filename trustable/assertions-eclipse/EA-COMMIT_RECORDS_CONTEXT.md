The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services / Git Commit Records)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit) and [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Community / Issues](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#community-issues) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

Eclipse Foundation projects must follow rules for Git commits to ensure transparency, traceability, and legal compliance.

Key requirements:

__Author identity__

* The Author field must include the contributorâ€™s real legal name and a valid email address.
* The email must match the address registered with the Eclipse Foundation (case-sensitive).
* The contributor must have a signed Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA) on file.

__Commit message structure__

* Summary line (max 72 characters): A clear, self-contained description of the change. Best practice: include the bug/issue ID.
* Description: A detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
* Footer: Optional metadata, such as additional authors.

__Co-authors__

* Use Also-by: or Co-authored-by: entries for additional contributors, each with their real name and Eclipse-registered email address.
* All additional authors must also have signed the ECA.

__Best practice__

* Keep summary lines meaningful because they appear in commit listings.
* Use the description and footer for additional context and attribution.
* Link commits to relevant issue tracker entries whenever possible.

Following these rules guarantees proper attribution, legal compliance, and clear project history.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Project Commit Records
