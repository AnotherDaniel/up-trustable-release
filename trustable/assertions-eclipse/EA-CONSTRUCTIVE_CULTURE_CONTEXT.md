The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Community)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#community) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

Eclipse projects are expected to actively foster a welcoming, constructive, and responsive community. All discussions, decisions, and issue tracking must take place publicly and respectfully to encourage participation, lower barriers for contributors, and grow a diverse and vibrant project ecosystem.

Key expectations for project teams:

__Welcoming communication__: Maintain polite, professional, and supportive discussions in all public channels (forums, mailing lists, issue trackers). Negative or dismissive behavior is discouraged.
__Constructive issue management__: Respond to all questions and reported issues promptly. Clearly distinguish between defects and feature requests, and ensure that issues are tracked and updated visibly.
__Transparency__: Capture project decisions, schedules, and milestones in public forums, inviting community input.
__Responsiveness__: No question or issue should remain unanswered for long; timely engagement is crucial to building trust and respect.
__Empowerment__: Encourage the community to answer questions and contribute, while providing guidance or corrections politely if needed.
__Traceability__: Link commits to their related issues so that discussions and decisions can be easily followed and understood.

By maintaining open, respectful communication and resolving issues efficiently, projects build credibility, attract contributors, and ensure the long-term success of their ecosystem.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Project repository, related infrastructure like discussion boards and issue trackers
