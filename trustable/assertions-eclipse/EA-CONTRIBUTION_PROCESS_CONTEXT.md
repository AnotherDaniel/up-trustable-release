The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Legal Documentation Requirements/Contributor Guide)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-contributor) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

Eclipse projects are required to provide a clearly documented and publicly accessible contribution process to lower barriers for new contributors and support community growth. This is typically done through a CONTRIBUTING.md file placed in the root of each repository.

The contribution guide should be concise, easy to read, and include:

* Project name and brief description
* Links to the project website, documentation, and Eclipse Terms of Use
* Main communication channels for contacting the project team
* Canonical source code repositories
* Steps for setting up the development environment (sources, dependencies, tools, build instructions)
* Mechanics for contributing (e.g., GitHub pull requests or GitLab merge requests)
* Legal requirements for contributions, including the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA) and Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Additionally, the guide should define any project-specific contribution rules, such as code formatting, quality standards, and review processes. If different repositories follow different rules, these differences must be explicitly documented. A well-structured contribution guide ensures transparency, streamlines onboarding, and helps contributions reach the project efficiently.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* File CONTRIBUTING.md or relevant information in README.md exists
* Guidelines are being followed in PRs
