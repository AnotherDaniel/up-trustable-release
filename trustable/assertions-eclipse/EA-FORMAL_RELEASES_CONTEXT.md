The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Releases and Reviews/Releases)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#release-releases) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

Releases for Eclipse projects are formal and follow an iterative process. They are categorized as:

* __Major releases__: Include API changes that may break downstream compatibility.
* __Minor releases__: Add new functionality while maintaining API compatibility.
* __Service releases__: Contain only bug fixes and no significant new features.

Each release cycle begins with a public plan created openly for community review and input. Development is iterative, with regular milestone builds for feedback, and concludes with a final release candidate and general availability.

Only projects in good standing — those that have completed a progress review within the past year — may issue major or minor releases. Service releases based on an official release do not require additional reviews. Throughout the release process, project teams must continuously follow the Eclipse IP Due Diligence Process to ensure proper intellectual property management, with progress reviews serving as a confirmation of ongoing compliance rather than a late-stage cleanup.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Release review documentation on eclipse.org
* PMC approval votes for releases, e.g. documented on level of release PR / MR
