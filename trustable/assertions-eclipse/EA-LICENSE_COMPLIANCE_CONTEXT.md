The [Eclipse Foundation Development Process section 6.4](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process_2018/#6_4_Releases) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

---

Projects may issue Releases, which are any distributions made outside the Projectâ€™s Committers. All Releases must comply with the Eclipse IP Policy, be approved according to Eclipse Foundation requirements, and provide a clear link between the released artifacts and their source code. Projects may issue Releases for up to one year following a successful Progress or Release Review, with additional reviews required at the discretion of the Project Leadership Chain.

Certain exceptions apply:

* Nightly and Integration Builds: Shared only with developers and early adopters, without public promotion.
* Milestone and Release Candidate Builds: Publicly shareable for testing, but clearly labeled and accompanied by disclaimers indicating they are not official Releases.
* Service Releases without new features: May be issued without an additional review.

All Releases from Projects in the Incubation Phase must be clearly marked as such (see Incubation Branding). Proper Releases, reviews, and labeling are mandatory to ensure software quality.

---

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* License compliance tool results
* Third-party license obligation fulfillment documentation
