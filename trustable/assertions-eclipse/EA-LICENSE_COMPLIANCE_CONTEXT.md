The [Eclipse Foundation Development Process section 6.4](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process_2018/#6_4_Releases) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

---

Releases in Eclipse projects must strictly adhere to the [Eclipse Foundation IP Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Eclipse_IP_Policy.pdf) to ensure legal compliance and maintain project quality. Any build distributed outside of the project's committers constitutes a Release and must follow the formal approval process.

Key Requirements:

* __IP Policy Compliance__: Before any Release, the Project Lead must confirm that all IP due diligence and approvals are complete in accordance with the Eclipse IP Policy.
* __Source Linkage__: Every Release artifact must be traceable to its corresponding source code.
* __Release Validity__: Projects can make official Releases for one year following a successful Progress or Release Review; additional reviews may be required by the project leadership.

Exceptions:

* Nightly & Integration Builds: Allowed only for developers and early adopters; no public links should encourage general use.
* Milestone & Release Candidate Builds: May be shared publicly with clear labeling and caveats (e.g. alpha, beta, RC).
* Service Releases: Maintenance updates without new features do not require a new review.

---

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* License compliance tool results
* Third-party license obligation fulfillment documentation
