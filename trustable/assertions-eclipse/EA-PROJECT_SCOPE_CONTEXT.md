A clear and realistic project scope is essential for ensuring project success at the Eclipse Foundation. It provides focus, helps the community evaluate proposals, and prevents misaligned initiatives.

Each proposal must include:

* A well-defined scope (3â€“5 sentences, present tense)
* Initial project leads and committers

Project metadata, including scope, must be kept up to date.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Project charter documents on eclipse.org
