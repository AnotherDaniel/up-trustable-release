The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services/External Resources)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-external) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

---

Project teams may use external services (e.g., GitHub, DockerHub) provided they comply with Eclipse Foundation rules. All such usage must respect Eclipse branding guidelines, ensure that service terms do not conflict with project licenses or copyrights, and grant ownership rights to one or more project committers. Additionally, services must be operated in an open, transparent, meritocratic, and vendor-neutral way, with shared administrative control among a diverse subset of committers and a documented policy for managing access.

External services may be used for:

* User forum discussions (e.g., Slack)
* Builds and alternative download sources
* Container image management (e.g., DockerHub)
* Examples, presentations, blogs, and social media

Project leads must review the terms of any external service with their PMC and the EMO to ensure compliance with project licenses, the Eclipse IP Policy, and the Eclipse Foundation Development Process.

However, source code, documentation, and issue tracking must live on Eclipse-managed infrastructure.

---

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Source code repo is part of Eclipse-managed organization
