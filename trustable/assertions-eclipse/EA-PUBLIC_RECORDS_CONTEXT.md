The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services / External Resources)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-external), as well as the [Eclipse Foundation Development Process (section 2.1)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process_2018/#2_1_Open_Source_Rules_of_Engagement) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

Eclipse projects must conduct all essential project activities—including source code, documentation, issue tracking, and bug reporting—on publicly accessible Eclipse Foundation infrastructure. This ensures that development is open, transparent, and inclusive. While external services (e.g., GitHub, DockerHub) may be used for auxiliary purposes such as user forums, builds, or container management, they must not replace Eclipse-managed infrastructure for core project resources.

Projects must also follow Eclipse’s key principles:

__Openness__: Participation is open to all under the same rules, with no exclusion of contributors or competing vendors.
__Transparency__: Project discussions, decisions, plans, and records must be public and easy to access.
__Meritocracy__: Responsibility and leadership are earned through contributions, recognized by the community.

External services must not impose legal terms that conflict with project licenses, must share administrative control among multiple committers, and must not create barriers for contributors. All project-related communication and decision-making should remain vendor-neutral and documented in public, ensuring that the project community can fully engage and collaborate.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Project repository, related infrastructure like discussion boards and issue trackers
