The [Eclipse Foundation Security Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/) defines how Eclipse Foundation projects deal with reported security issues:

The Eclipse Foundation Security Policy represents a mature, industry-standard approach to vulnerability management that addresses the security concerns enterprises face when adopting open source software. The purpose of the Eclipse Foundation Security Policy is to set forth the general principles under which the Eclipse Foundation manages the reporting, management, discussion, and disclosure of Vulnerabilities discovered in Eclipse software, creating a framework that rivals commercial software vendors in its rigor and transparency.

**Two-Tier Security Architecture:**

The policy establishes a sophisticated dual-layer security structure with the Eclipse Foundation Security Team as the first line of defense: they triage reports, redirect them to the appropriate Project's Security team or the EMO team, provide assistance and guidance in the resolution. This ensures both centralized coordination and project-specific expertise, preventing security issues from falling through organizational cracks.

**Systematic Vulnerability Lifecycle:**

Unlike ad-hoc open source security practices, Eclipse mandates comprehensive vulnerability tracking from initial report through full disclosure. All Vulnerabilities must be resolved and All Vulnerabilities must eventually be fully disclosed to the community at large, ensuring transparency while protecting users during the resolution period.

**Coordinated Disclosure Framework:**

The policy supports progressive, coordinated, and quiet disclosure options depending on severity and circumstances, allowing for responsible handling of critical vulnerabilities while maintaining community transparency. This flexibility enables proper coordination with downstream users and commercial redistributors.

**Accountability and Governance:**

In the unlikely event that a project team does not engage in good faith to resolve a Vulnerability, a member of EMO may – at their discretion – initiate the Grievance Process, ensuring that security responsibilities are enforced rather than merely encouraged.

This comprehensive approach provides the security governance that enterprises require when building critical systems on open source foundations, matching the security practices of commercial software vendors while maintaining open source transparency principles.
