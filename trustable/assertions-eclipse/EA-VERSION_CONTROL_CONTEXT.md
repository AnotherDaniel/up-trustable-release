The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Project Resources and Services)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#project-resources-and-services) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

---

Eclipse Foundation projects must use the infrastructure and services provided to ensure traceability, proper attribution of contributions, and compliance with open source best practices.

Key requirements include:

__Version control__: All source code must be maintained in the project’s assigned Eclipse Git repository (GitLab or GitHub). This ensures proper attribution of changes, a transparent history of contributions, and clear ownership of commits.
__Issue tracking__: All project issues and bug reports must be tracked in the official Eclipse-managed issue tracker to keep discussions and decisions publicly accessible.
__Attribution and traceability__: Commits must be linked to their related issues and should include meaningful commit messages. This allows anyone reviewing the history to understand why changes were made and by whom.
__Vetted content__: All third-party content used by the project must be properly reviewed to meet licensing and intellectual property (IP) requirements.
__Eclipse services__: Projects must use Eclipse-provided infrastructure for builds, artifact signing, mailing lists, and communication to ensure transparency and a level playing field.
__Metadata maintenance__: Project metadata must be kept up-to-date to reflect accurate information about repositories, committers, and resources.

By using Eclipse’s infrastructure correctly, projects maintain a clear, auditable development history, properly credit contributors, and strengthen trust within the community.

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Git commit history with author attribution
* Pull/merge request records with review history
