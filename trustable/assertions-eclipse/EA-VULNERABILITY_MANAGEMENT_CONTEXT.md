The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook (section Managing and Reporting Vulnerabilities)](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability) states that (please refer to the official Eclipse document for definitive and canonical definitions):

---

Eclipse Foundation projects must implement vulnerability reporting taking into account to the following mechanisms and roles:

__Policy__: Follow the Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Policy.
__Eclipse Security Team__: First contact for vulnerabilities → email security@eclipse-foundation.org or use the general vulnerability tracker.
__Project Security Team__: Handles undisclosed vulnerabilities (by default, all committers). Teams may be limited to selected committers with security expertise.

Required setup:

* Provide a security contact to Eclipse Security Team.
* Maintain a private security mailing list and/or confidential issue tracker (GitLab/GitHub).
* Clearly document reporting methods in SECURITY.md.

Reporting: Use project-specific confidential trackers where possible; otherwise, use the general tracker or email security@eclipse-foundation.org.

__Disclosure__: Start private, then follow Eclipse’s disclosure policy until public listing on the Known Vulnerabilities page.

---

Evidence for compliance might include (but is not limited to):

* Records of analysis, fix and disclosure activies for reported vulnerabilities
