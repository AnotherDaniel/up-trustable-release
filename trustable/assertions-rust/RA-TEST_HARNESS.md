Project is using Rust test tooling and core framework runners. Any additional test harnesses and approaches are integrated with the core test setup and are run in the same (automated) manner.

For instance, the behavior-driven [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) test framework can be integrated with the Rust test harness using [cucumber-rs](https://cucumber-rs.github.io/cucumber/main/).
