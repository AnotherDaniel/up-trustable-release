**Guidance**

This assertion requires that that we have control over all changes to XYZ,
including changes to the configurations, components and tools we use to build
it, and the versions of dependencies that we use.

This means, the trustable controlled process is the only path to production for constructed target
software.

**Evidence**

- change management process and configuration artifacts

**Confidence scoring**

CS-A_07 is based on confidence that we have
control over the changes that we make to XYZ, including its configuration and
dependencies.

**Checklist**
- Where are the change and configuration management controls specified?
- Are these controls enforced for all of components, tools and configurations?
- Are there any ways in which these controls can be subverted, and have we mitigated them?
