**Guidance**

To satisfy this assertion, the manual processes applied in the verification of
XYZ must be documented, together with the methodologies used, the results of
applying these processes to specific aspects and iterations of XYZ or its
components, and evidence that they have been reviewed using documented criteria.

Any data analysis for TA-A_13 should ideally be mostly automated to establish
continuous feedback mechanisms. However, specifically, manual processes - such
as those used for quality control assurances and the appropriate assignment of
responsibilities - must be documented as evidence for TA-A_14.

**Evidence**

- Manual process documentation
- References to methodologies applied as part of these processes
- Results of applying the processes
- Criteria used to confirm that the processes were applied correctly
- Review records for results

**Confidence scoring**

CS-TA-A_14 is based on identifying areas of need for manual processes, assessing the clarity of proposed processes, analysing the results of their implementation, and evaluating the evidence of effectiveness in comparison to the analysed results

**Checklist**

- Are the identified gaps documented clearly to justify using a manual process?
- Are the goals for each process clearly defined?
- Is the sequence of procedures documented in an unambiguous manner?
- Can improvements to the processes be suggested and implemented?
- How frequently are processes changed?
- How are changes to manual processes communicated?
- Are there any exceptions to the processes?
- How is evidence of process adherence recorded?
- How is the effectiveness of the process evaluated?
- Is ongoing training required to follow these processes?
