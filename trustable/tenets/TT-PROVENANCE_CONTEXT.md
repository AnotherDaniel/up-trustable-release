**Guidance**

Our trust in uProtocol is informed by both the individuals and organisations contributing to it, and by the software tools and components used to develop and maintain it.

Ideally we want all uProtocol contributors to be expert, motivated, reliable, transparent and ethical. Unfortunately this is not always achievable in practice:

- Given the scale, complexity and evolution of modern software systems it is impossible for engineers to be expert in all topics.
- Even the most competent engineers have bad days.
- Many engineers are unable to share information due to commercial secrecy agreements.
- Individuals and teams may be motivated or manipulated by external pressures, e.g. money and politics.

We can and should, however, consider who produced uProtocol and its components, their motivations and practices, the assertions they make, supporting evidence for these assertions, and feedback from users of uProtocol if available.

Similarly, we want existing software used to create uProtocol to be well documented, actively maintained, thoroughly tested, bug-free and well suited to its use in uProtocol. In practice, we will rarely have all of this, but we can at least evaluate the software components of uProtocol, and the tools used to construct it.
