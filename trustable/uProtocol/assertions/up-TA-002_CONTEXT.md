The goal of this assertion is to ensure that foundational building blocks used by uProtocol are build by live communities, which are

- continually keeping their dependencies fresh
- reactive with regards to reported issues and potential security findings
- keeping up with core language advances and current tooling versions

This is especially relevant for dependencies that contribute major/fundamental capabilities. It might be relaxed for less prominent/smaller dependencies, which are easier to replace if that should become necessary.

For practicality reasons, this rule also is supposed to apply to first-level dependencies of uProtocol. Chosing well-run projects on that level increases the likelyhood that transitive dependencies will be actively managed and kept fresh by these projects.
