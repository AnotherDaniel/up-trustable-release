Dependencies (crates) used in uProtocol Rust projects are vetted regarding the aspects:

- license compatibility: only open source licenses that are compatible with and whitelisted by the project
- liveness of the project: the repository behind a crate is not abandoned (has commits within the last 12 months), and issues are recognized and accepted(*)
